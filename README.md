# p5.js template

This code is a “starter kit” for using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) with a sketch
written as a [JavaScript
module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

"Event" functions, that [p5.js documents](https://p5js.org/reference/) but that
are defined in the sketch, must be prefixed by `export` in order to be visible
to p5.js. For example, `export function setup()` and `export function draw()` in
the starter code.

Tristan helped with figuring out the water droplets as well as the rectangle and how the water enters from only one specific side of the rectangle.
