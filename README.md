# p5.js template

This code is a “starter kit” for using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) with a sketch
written as a [JavaScript
module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

"Event" functions, that [p5.js documents](https://p5js.org/reference/) but that
are defined in the sketch, must be prefixed by `export` in order to be visible
to p5.js. For example, `export function setup()` and `export function draw()` in
the starter code.

## Instructions

move the IMU around both by rotating the IMU horizontally, the flat side of the IMU facing the user's body, and rotating the IMU vertically, as if pushing the IMU in a forward motion. The horizontal rotation will rotate the cup, and the vertical rotation will move the cup back and forth across the screen.

Tristan helped with figuring out the water droplets as well as the rectangle and how the water enters from only one specific side of the rectangle.
